This my NSS (part 1) Capstone project. This is an app that's purpose is for "movie nerds" to keep track of what they have seen and organize most popular data in a fashion to use for discussion later. First type a movie in a search bar. That search bar will display a list of movies depending on your input (which will reference omdb api). Once selecting a suggested movie a form with pre-loaded movie data will display and the user will enter a review along with some other info. Then this review and info will be stored in a table that can be sorted based on most popular information. I am doing GET, DELETE, POST with JSON objects in order to make this app functional.

-This app is almost completely in functional mode, so there is very little styling to appeal to the average user.  
-Still need to add in clearing search bar, preloaded form data, and previous input functions
-need to complete which information will be displayed on the table vs. the tooltip.
